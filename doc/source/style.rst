Type annotation
===============

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Python 3 does allow you to do type annotations, though they are
currently only used by IDEs like
`PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__ to check code
statically. I adopt this official soultion. See ``typing`` moduleâ€™s
`documentation
page <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/typing.html#module-typing>`__.
