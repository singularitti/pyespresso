Python version support
----------------------

Officially Python 3.5, and 3.6.

Installing from PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pandas can be installed via pip from
`PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyque>`__.

::

    pip install pyque

This will likely require the installation of a number of dependencies,
including NumPy, will require a compiler to compile required bits of code,
and can take a few minutes to complete.

Dependencies
------------

* `setuptools <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__: 3.3.0 or higher
* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`__: 1.9.0 or higher
