# Documentation style

We recommend you use the IDE (integrated development environment) [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). It extracts your type annotations from your docstrings. It uses a language called [Epytext markup language](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-epytext.html). Please read that page carefully.
